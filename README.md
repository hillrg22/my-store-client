# Storefront

This is an E-Commerce app built with React and Node.js. With this app, I challenged myself to learn two new technologies that I can implement into future apps; Stripe and Auth0. 

## Technologies

### Front-End
* React
* Stripe
* Auth0

### Back-End [View Repository](https://github.com/hillrg22/my-store-server)
* Node.js
* Express
* Sequelize
* PostgreSQL



## To Do
- [x] Profile Page pulls user information from Google when signed in through Auth0
- [ ] User can edit profile details from profile page
- [ ] User profile information should be displayed in a form-type layout
- [ ] Home page should display relevant seller information
- [x] Basic Stripe checkout implementation (user can navigate to a particular product detail page and purchase the item)
- [ ] User can add multiple items to a shopping cart
- [ ] User can choose the quantity of a particular item to purchase
- [x] If a user types in a path that they do not have access to, he or she will be redirected to the login page
- [ ] User interface styling improvements 
- [x] User should be able to navigate between pages through the use of a navbar 
- [x] User Authentication with Auth0
- [x] When a user is not logged in, he or she should see a "log in" button that will redirect to Auth0 authentication
- [x] When a user IS logged in, he or she should see a "log out" button that will log him/her out of the application
- [x] The user should only see the "Profile" navbar option when he/she is logged in 
- [x] When the user clicks on the "Products" tab, available products should render in individual card components on the page
- [ ] A user with admin credentials can add new products to the online storefront
